# mc_server_status
A nonebot plugin of minecraft server status check plugin

**This branch is a implementation of sematic matching over the original plugin.** 

- The finetuning process can be found in file `fine-tuning`

- final plugin can be found in file `mc_server_status`

- The model is not uploaded due to file-size limit on github, you can get the model by re build the model using notebooks in fine-tuning.

The Plugin requires [nonebot API](https://nonebot.dev/) and proper listener with onebot adapter to work.
